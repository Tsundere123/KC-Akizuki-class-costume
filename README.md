This is a file for laser cutting the details for the turret house

I personally used 3mm plywood for the circles and 2mm EVA foam for the rest


## Suzu 10cm turret v23.3mf
I print the turret head upside down

Barrels I print standing (They are rifled! Suggest printing at low layer height, slowly. Especially if you have a printer with the bed as X or Y axis)


The arms are in multiple pieces

The pin inside of the actual arm rotating mechanism is spring loaded. You're going to have to add your own spring (""Borrow"" a cheapo pen from work and use that)

I use a small diameter nail and hotglue the ends to secure the arm itself to the rotating cradle.


The base of the turret itself has 4 locking lugs. Skip printing those if you want. They're still in the model, I'll fix that at a later point
